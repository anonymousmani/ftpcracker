# Python FTP Credential Login Brute-Force Attack using Threads

Welcome to the Python FTP Credential Login Brute-Force Attack repository! This project showcases a Python script that leverages the power of multi-threading to perform a brute-force attack on FTP servers. By systematically trying different username-password combinations, this tool aims to discover weak or vulnerable credentials. It is a demonstration of the importance of strong, secure credentials and the need for robust authentication mechanisms.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Threading**: Utilizes Python's threading module to create multiple threads, each dedicated to attempting a different set of username-password combinations, thus accelerating the brute-force process.

- **Customizable**: Users can specify the target FTP server, a list of usernames, and a list of passwords to test against. This allows for flexibility and customization in your security assessments.

- **Logging and Output**: Provides detailed logging of login attempts and successes, making it useful for security auditing and analysis.

- **Educational**: Offers insights into the importance of secure credentials and the risks of weak passwords, serving as a valuable educational tool for cybersecurity enthusiasts and professionals.

## üíª Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com//anonymousmani/ftpcracker.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ftpcracker
   ```
3. Install requirement first:
   ```
   python install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python ftpcracked.py
   ```

   The script will use multiple threads to perform the brute-force attack.
