# ftpcracker
Welcome to the Python FTP Credential Login Brute-Force Attack repository! This project showcases a Python script that leverages the power of multi-threading to perform a brute-force attack on FTP servers. By systematically trying different username-password combinations, this tool aims to discover weak or vulnerable credentials.
